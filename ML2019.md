1. What is Machine Learning and what applications you an apply ML? 
2. What are basic categories of ML algorithms. (superviosed and un-suoervised)
3. What are linear regression? given a class of students that weights (by KGs) are 55,55,57,58,60,57,60,74 and heights (by CMs) 165,166,171,173,177,172,179, 183, can you utilize liner regression to build a model based on this dataset? For example, if a student weights is 62 KGs, what is her/his height by your model.
4.What are logistic regression, what is sigmoid function and can you take derivative of sigmoid function? 
5. Could you implement a decision tree prediction algorithm by whatever language you are familiar with? 
6. Please explain overfitting, underfitting, bias, and variance.
